## Goals

We're building a monorepo of tools to facilitate agentic development:

- Agentic issue tracking
- Agentic messaging/mail
- Agentic codebase exploration
- Agentic fetching/research

## Helix

All our tools are powered by Helix-DB, cloned locally here:
/Users/kevinchen/dev/github.com/HelixDB/helix-db

## Kiro Specs

Kiro Specs bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details, ensuring alignment and reducing development iterations. Kiro generates three key files that form the foundation of each specification:

requirements.md - Captures user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation
design.md - Documents technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
tasks.md - Provides a detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks

More details here: https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/

## Issue Tracking

We're building an alternative to beads (`bd`) called `hbd`.
See ./hbd/specs for its specs.
Beads is cloned locally to /Users/kevinchen/dev/github.com/steveyegge/beads.
