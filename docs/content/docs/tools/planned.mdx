# Planned Tools

Tools that are planned but not yet scaffolded.

For scaffolded tools (architecture defined, implementation pending), see:
- [helix-docs](/docs/tools/helix-docs) — Documentation cache
- [helix-repo](/docs/tools/helix-repo) — Repository clone manager

For active tools, see:
- [hbd](/docs/tools/hbd) — Issue tracker
- [helix-map](/docs/tools/helix-map) — Codebase indexer

<Callout type="info">
  These tools are in the planning stage. APIs and features may change.
</Callout>

## helix-mail

**Agent-to-agent messaging and coordination.**

As multi-agent workflows become common, agents need to communicate. helix-mail will provide:

- Asynchronous message passing
- Topic-based routing
- Message persistence
- Integration with hbd issues

```bash
# Send a message
helix-mail send --to agent-b --topic "refactoring" "Starting work on auth module"

# Check messages
helix-mail inbox

# Subscribe to topics
helix-mail subscribe "builds" "deployments"
```
