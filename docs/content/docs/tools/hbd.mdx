# hbd

**A distributed, git-first issue tracker built for AI-supervised workflows.**

The name pays homage to both **H**elix and **B**ea**d**s — the excellent issue tracker by Steve Yegge that inspired this project.

<Callout type="info">
  hbd is currently in active development. Core features are being implemented.
</Callout>

## Why hbd?

Traditional issue trackers store your data in someone else's cloud. When you need to work offline, or when AI agents need fast access to project context, that's a problem.

hbd keeps your issues:

- **In your repo** — Issues are Markdown files in `.tickets/`
- **In your control** — No cloud service required
- **Searchable by meaning** — Not just keywords

## Key Features

### Semantic Search

<Callout type="warn">Coming Soon</Callout>

Find issues by what they mean, not just what words they contain. This feature will use local embeddings via `fastembed` to power vector search.

```bash
# Traditional search: keyword matching
hbd search "auth"

# Semantic search: finds "login", "sign-in", "authentication" too
hbd search "user can't log in" --semantic

# Hybrid: combines both approaches with reranking
hbd search "memory leak" --hybrid
```

### Dependency Graphs

hbd understands blocking relationships between issues. You can identify unblocked tasks and visualize dependency chains.

```bash
# What can I work on right now? (no open blockers)
hbd ready

# What's blocked and why?
hbd blocked

# Visualize the blocker tree
hbd explain bd-123
```

<Callout type="warn">
  **Coming Soon:** `hbd critical-path` will use graph algorithms to identify the longest chain of dependencies blocking an epic or milestone.
</Callout>

### AI Agent Support

Every command is designed to work with AI coding assistants, providing structured output and session tracking.

```bash
# JSON output for structured parsing
hbd list --json

# Track which agent created/modified issues
hbd create "Fix the bug" --agent claude --session abc123
```

<Callout type="warn">
  **Coming Soon:** `hbd context` will provide project summaries optimized for LLM token limits, and `hbd compact` will summarize old closed issues to reclaim context window space.
</Callout>

### Git-Native Sync

Issues are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: bd-a1b2c3
title: Fix memory leak in parser
status: open
priority: 1
type: bug
labels: [performance, parser]
depends_on:
  - id: bd-x7y8z9
    type: blocks
---

The parser leaks memory when processing large files...
```

These files merge cleanly in git. Hash-based IDs prevent conflicts across branches. Your issues travel with your code.

## Commands

For a full list of commands and flags, see the [CLI Reference](/docs/tools/cli-reference).

## Compared to Beads

[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) is excellent. If you're happy with it, keep using it! hbd exists because we wanted capabilities that require a graph-vector database:

| Feature | Beads | hbd |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Storage | SQLite | HelixDB |
| Keyword search | Yes | Yes |
| Semantic search | No | Yes |
| Hybrid search + reranking | No | Yes |
| Dependency tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Graph algorithms (critical path) | Limited | Full |
| Offline embeddings | No | Yes (fastembed) |

### What We Kept from Beads

- Git-backed storage in `.tickets/`
- Hash-based IDs for conflict-free merging  
- Dependency tracking with blocking semantics
- AI compaction for context window management
- Agent tracking with `--agent` and `--session` flags
- `ready` and `blocked` commands

### What We Simplified

- Fewer issue types (6 vs 12+)
- No molecular chemistry (templates, wisps, bonds)
- Single daemon architecture
